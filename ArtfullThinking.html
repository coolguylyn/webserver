		<h1>Goals</h1>
				<p>For a long time,
				drawing has been considered to be a thing for just a few people who are talented and passionate about it. However, there is more to drawing than just marking images on a piece of paper. Drawing is a way of thinking in itself. It is a way one can express their emotions and bring meaning to moments in their lives. There are a number of benefits that come with drawing and MTG lion explains why drawing is good for you.</p>
		
				<p>Our goals are to inform parents about performing arts, music genres, and how they impact your children. As children, music really impacts us. It help our confidence, not just playing instruments, but also listen to them. Bands like BTS, Nirvana, FUN.,  AC/DC, and Yungblud all the words they speak make us feel better about our-self. Whether it is telling us not to care, that you can do whatever you put your mind to.</p>
	
				<p>Dance is more than the exploring of different ways to make a shape or learning a series of steps to music;
				it is a way of moving that uses the body as an instrument of expression and communication. Through dance, students learn teamwork, focus, and improvisational skills. Dance awakens new perceptions in children which help them learn and think in new ways.</p>	
				
				<p>Our goal with this website is to convince parents that anything involving art or performance isn't a waste of time and should be considered if kids wish to go into those hobbies.</p>
